<!--I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGOLr3JHbg as my basis/inspiration for this assignment. It relates to text, not tiles but the concept is the same. Still, there's no html directly taken from the video here.-->
<!--I originally proposed to work on my friend's website as the course project but have changed concepts. My new plan is to design a website for a fictional architecture firm.-->
<!--I'm not sure where to put the new README.md file but would be happy to explain more in that file if it would be helpful.-->
<!--I'm still looking for the API that will connect to this website. One difficulty is that searches for "API architecture" yield results not about APIs dealing with archiecture but with the archiecture of APIs.-->
<!--Perhaps I'll use an API that relates to housing/the housing market. If you have any other ideas or suggestions, please let me know. For now, this website says, "Other" for the category that will eventually use the API.-->
